Here's my first blog entry. The blog name is from a [Charles Bukowski](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/136495-the-days-run-away-like-wild-horses-over-the-hills) poem, I don't so much identify with the content (as usual for him it's about being drunk) but the title is a poem in itself...

Today I'm marking assignments and exams. Perhaps that's what drives me to [blog](http://www.advogato.org/person/stevecassidy/diary.html?start=0).
