[SpeechBot](http://speechbot.research.compaq.com/) is a is a search engine for audio & video content that is hosted and played from other websites. Recordings are indexed via speech recognition on the audio. A very interesting experiment which seems to work for some queries; the transcripts are obviously noisy but it's obvious that if a particular term is repeated often in a piece then it will get indexed well. My search for [ancient history troy](http://speechbot.research.compaq.com/?q=ancient+history+troy&topic=*&dr=*) returned a few relevant results but many false hits due to _troy_ being an easily inserted token.
