John Udell is taggins some of his [del.icio.us links](http://del.icio.us/judell/transcriptavailable+podcast) to podcasts with <tt>transcriptavailable</tt>, transcripts have been generated manually. This could be a nice source of data for experiments with information retrieval from podcasts. 

Sort of relatedly, I just discovered [LibriVox](http://librivox.org/) which hosts volunteer recordings of out of copyright literary works (eg. Project Gutenberg books). I sampled War of the Worlds and the quality seems great. Worth a browse.
