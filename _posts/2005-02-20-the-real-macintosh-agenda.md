Did you know...

> Take for example Apple Computers, makers of the popular Macintosh line of computers. The real operating system hiding under the newest version of the Macintosh operating system (MacOS X) is called... Darwin! That's right, new Macs are based on Darwinism! While they currently don't advertise this fact to consumers, it is well known among the computer elite, who are mostly Atheists and Pagans. Furthermore, the Darwin OS is released under an &#8220;Open Source&#8221; license, which is just another name for Communism. They try to hide all of this under a facade of shiny, &#8220;lickable&#8221; buttons, but the truth has finally come out: Apple Computers promote Godless Darwinism and Communism.
