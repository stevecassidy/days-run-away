In a thread on [Slashdot | More on MIT OpenCourseWare](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/22/1634209&mode=flat&tid=146) the discussion turns to whether this makes going to university pointless, if you can study online and perhaps get yourself some certificates from Micosoft, is there a point in attending University for 3-4 years?

Related to the MIT initiative (to publish all of their courseware on the net) someone mentions that [Cornell](http://cybertower.cornell.edu/index.html) already has a program to do something similar.

I've always published my coursework on the web ever since there's been a web to publish it on. In my experience it's given me benifits in terms of exposure to the world and I doubt very much whether it's cost the University any students.
