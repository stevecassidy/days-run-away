The Linguistic Annotation Framework defines a generalised graph based  
model for annotation data intended as an interchange format for transfer  
of annotations between tools.   The DADA system uses an RDF based representation  
of annotation data and provides a web based annotation store.  The annotation  
model in DADA can be seen as an RDF realisation of the LAF model. This paper  
describes the relationship between the two models and makes some comments on  
how the standard might be stated in a more format-neutral way.
