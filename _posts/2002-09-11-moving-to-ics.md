So, I've finally forwarded my [Home Page](http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~cassidy/) from SHLRC to ICS, which I guess means that after 9 months here I've finally arrived, or rather it means that I've now gotten some of the [cgi script](http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~cassidy/cgi-bin/installer) that lived on the old server going over here.

CANTCL (the script above) is a Tcl extension archive and is now running under [tclkit](http://mini.net/tcl/52) making it more easily portable between machines. The solaris based server over here does seem rather sluggish though.
