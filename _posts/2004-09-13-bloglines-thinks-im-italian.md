So I've just started using [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) as a blog aggregator and it's working well thanks to the Firefox plugin that makes subscription and seeing updates easy. If you care you could see <a>my subscriptions</a>. A nice feature is that the site will recommend new feeds to read based on your subscriptions but for some reason it has decided that I'd like to read all kinds of Italian sites! So what is it in my subscriptions that enables this inference? Answers on a postcard please...
