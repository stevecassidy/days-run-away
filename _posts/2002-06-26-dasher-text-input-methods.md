 [Dasher](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/DasherSummary2.html) is a new input method which uses an ngram language model to predict the next letter you want to enter but lets you select it by &#8216;flying' through regions of the screen approaching from the right. They have a tcl download demo version. I managed to enter some text without trauma. A neat idea but how useable would it be on a palmtop since it takes up most of the screen real estate itself. 

I remember being impressed a long time ago with chord keyboards, someone demonstrated a five finger keyboard in Edinburgh and I was able to type within a few minutes, surely there's scope for combining that with a palmtop to do better than the qwerty thumb keyboards that are coming out now.
