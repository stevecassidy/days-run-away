My brothers are way more productive than me when it comes to generating cool websites. Via various routes we've all ended up working on the web, Patrick on [web design](http://www.yoqona.co.uk) and more recently selling [baby gifts](http://www.daisyzoo.com/), Mike on [online music stores](http://www.clubsoftly.net/index.php) and other bits of new media goodness. Me, I just [teach it](http://online.mq.edu.au/pub/COMP249/) and build sites and tools for relatively small groups of people. Between the three of us we could take over the world.
