While it's nice being the number two &#8216;Steve Cassidy' on Google (above the porn star but below the voiceover artist!) being well indexed can have it's down side. I recently noticed an odd Google search bringing traffic to [CANTCL](/~cassidy/cgi-bin/cantcl/) &#8212; the phrase &#8220;problem opening zip file&#8221; turns up CANTCL as the number one hit! If you check the [cached page](http://www.google.com.au/search?q=cache:xreuZJu5vv4J:www.ics.mq.edu.au/~cassidy/cgi-bin/cantcl+problem+opening+zip+file&hl=en&ie=UTF-8) (valid as of 25 Sept 03) it shows that Google came crawling while CANTCL was having trouble with one of the zip files in the archive. The shame, my bug (now fixed) is preserved forever. 

PS. let's see what kind of traffic the above mention of the &#8216;other' Steve Cassidy brings to this site...stay tuned ðŸ™‚
