[Don Park's Blog](http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2002/11/01.html#a123) say's the net needs zero install extensible client platforms which .Net and java webstart aren't. perhaps CANTCL can be something like that, especially along with starpacks we can have a zero install client application which can be extended and updated via  
web downloads each of which is relatively small. Why does the Java machinery have to be so damn big?
