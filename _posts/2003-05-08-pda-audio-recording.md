Since I bought my Dell Axim I've been looking for audio recording and playback products, since the supplied Windows Media software is pretty basic. Because of being interested in speech technology I'm keen to play around with recording audio on these kinds of devices but the built-in microphone is pretty basic so quality is never going to be high. 

Enter [Core Sound](http://www.core-sound.com/HighResRecorderNews.html) with a CF Card which takes S/PDIF audio inputs and does high quality recording to memory cards. Potentially neat but still lots of gear to carry around (it needs a mic pre-amp as well as external mics etc.) The page is also interesting as it points to some Pocket PC Audio software apps which do more than the basic job of recording digital audio. 

Combine the CF Audio card with [one of these](http://www.micsupply.com/ad20.htm) to get a reasonably compact 20 bit 44.1kHz two channel recording setup.
