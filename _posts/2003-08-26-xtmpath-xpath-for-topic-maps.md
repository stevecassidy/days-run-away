Robert Barta at Bond Uni has a paper on [XTMPath, Manipulating Topic Map Data Structures](http://topicmaps.it.bond.edu.au/docs/13/toc) which I should look at a little further. I enjoyed talking with Robert at the AusWeb conference this year, he seems to be one of the few people working on Topic Maps in Australia, unlike in Europe and the US where it seems that they're taking over the world (at least that's the impression I got at <a>Extreme Markup</a>. 

Then there's also [TMPath](http://homepage.mac.com/dmitryv/TopicMaps/TMPath/TMPathIntroduction.html) which is aiming at a similar place. Better get my skates on if [my proposal](http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~cassidy/papers/extreme03.html) is to be a contender.
