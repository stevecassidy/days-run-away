[Open Source Applications Foundation - Vista prototype](http://www.osafoundation.org/Vista_prototype.htm) is another outlook killer, perhaps interesting this time as it's based on an RDF database underneath and is written in Python/Tkinter. Some nice ideas.

I'm getting annoyed with evolution afer only a few weeks of using it in anger, it's too unstable and has quirks I can't get used to. I mostly like the calendar and palm integration and the mail handler seems good but isn't as polished as i'd like. Perhaps the next release will settle things a little.
