We're setting up a teleconferencing facility in order to collect data and experiment within our [meeting room project](). One of the problems is that we want to record the audio and video streams in as high quality as possible as well as sending them down the line compressed to run the teleconference. 

I came across this page on [IPAQ video conferencing](http://internet2.motlabs.com/ipaq/index.htm) at Motorola labs: an IPAQ running Linux doing video/audio conferencing over wireless networks.
