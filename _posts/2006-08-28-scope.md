So today I make my TV debut! A few weeks ago a film crew from Channel 10 came to shoot a segment for the CSIRO/Channel 10 kids science show [SCOPE](http://www.csiro.au/scope/). The episode, on sound, airs today at 4pm. 

I had great fun making the segment, I've never done anything like this before and it's amazing how much work goes in to producing such a short piece. I can't wait to see how it turns out. 

If you watched the show and are interested in having a look at speech you might want to download one of the programs I used in the show. The [WaveSurfer](http://www.speech.kth.se/wavesurfer/) tool (you want to get the Binary release for windows from [this page](http://www.speech.kth.se/wavesurfer/download.html)). Wavesurfer will let you record your voice and see the spectrogram patterns like the ones I was looking at on the show (you'll need a microphone for your computer, a cheap headset will do). To get a good looking display, select &#8220;New&#8221; from the File menu and choose &#8220;Demonstration&#8221; when asked what configuration to use. Then press the red record button and speak into the microphone. 

Here's an experiment to try: record yourself saying &#8220;hid&#8221;, &#8220;hod&#8221;, &#8220;head&#8221;, &#8220;had&#8221;. Look at the spectrogram of each word and see if you can tell the difference. Look particularly for the brigher bands in the display &#8212; these are called _formants_ and they're different for every vowel sound. 

Another experiment: record two children and an adult saying the same word, for example &#8220;SCOPE&#8221;. Can you tell the difference between them? Which looks more similar, the children's voices or one of the children and the adult? 

Please leave a comment if you've seen the show!
