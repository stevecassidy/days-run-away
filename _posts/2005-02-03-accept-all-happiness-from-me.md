Listening to Bjork's Medulla, [one track](http://www.stankygroove.com/albums/bjork.html) turns out to be a poem by [e. e. cummings](http://www.mamohanraj.com/Poets/cummi.html):

<pre>it may not always be so; and i say
that if your lips, which i have loved, should touch
another's, and your dear strong fingers clutch
his heart, as mine in time not far away;
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know, or such
great writhing words as, uttering overmuch,
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay;

if this should be, i say if this should be-
you of my heart, send me a little word;
that i may go unto him, and take his hands,
saying, Accept all happiness from me.
Then shall i turn my face, and hear one bird
sing terribly afar in the lost lands. 

-- e.e. cummings </pre>
