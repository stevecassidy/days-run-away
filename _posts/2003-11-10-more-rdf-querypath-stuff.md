The RDF query/manipulation proposals are coming out of the  
woodwork on www-rdf-rules:

  * [XR](http://w3future.com/xr/) does RDF extraction from XML
  * [Rx4RDF](http://rx4rdf.liminalzone.org/index) is &#8221; a specification and reference implementation for querying, transforming  
    and updating W3C's RDF by specifying a deterministic mapping of the RDF  
    model to the XML data model defined by XPath.&#8221;
