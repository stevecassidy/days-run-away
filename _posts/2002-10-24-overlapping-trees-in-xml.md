[xmlhack: One tree isn't enough](http://www.xmlhack.com/read.php?item=1790) talks about a couple of proposals for encoding overlapping trees.

LMNL is a non XML markup language which allows for overlapping ranges.JITT (Just in time trees) is an XML based system which can derive different trees by parsing the file differntly. They have a page on [Overlapping Hierarchies/Concurrent Markup](http://www.sbl-site2.org/Overlap/).

This looks like it deserves some more attention.
