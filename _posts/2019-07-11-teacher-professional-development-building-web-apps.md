I'm running a workshop today for High School teachers in the local area. The goal of the workshop is to provide an example framework for building simple web applications that might be useful for students doing HSC projects. The style of application is based on the material we use in our second year Web Technology unit. In that unit we aim to have the students understand everything about what is going on 'under the hood', but we can use the framework in a more practical way to build applications.
