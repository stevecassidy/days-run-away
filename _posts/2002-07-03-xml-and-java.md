[This book](http://www.awprofessional.com/catalog/product.asp?product_id={3B16B2C1-0CED-4D42-8884-1EDD7B2A0257}&selectDescTypeId={06B328CA-921B-4395-945D-3078CA6F292A}&st=5130B593-BAEC-49C6-B6A8-0035DFD1EA3B&session_id={FBAC416F-0130-4010-913E-DE3B1AD9EEDC}) swings into my conciousness, first I find it while browsing for a new text for our XML course, then slashdot [reviews it](http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/07/03/1512218&mode=flat&tid=108). They're not entirely positive about it for a beginner's XML book which doesn't bide well but it does seem to have a good spread of content that would make it a useful desk book.
