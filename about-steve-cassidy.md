I&#8217;m an Associate Professor in the [Computing Department](http://www.comp.mq.edu.au/) at [Macquarie University](http://www.mq.edu.au/), affiliated with the [Centre for Language Technology](http://www.clt.mq.edu.au/).

Until the end of 2001 I was with the [Speech Hearing and Language Research Centre](http://www.shlrc.mq.edu.au) which is part of the [Linguistics Department](http://www.ling.mq.edu.au) here. My research interests are in linguistic annotation, XML, speech technology systems and acoustic phonetics (here&#8217;s my [CV](about-steve-cassidy/curriculum-vitae/)).

I&#8217;m now living with my family in Sydney, [Australia](http://www.csu.edu.au/education/australia.html). I was born in [Sheffield](http://www.shef.ac.uk/city/), England and I&#8217;ve lived at various times in Edinburgh, Cambridge and Wellington, New Zealand.

When I&#8217;m not being an academic, I&#8217;m riding my bike, fiddling with electronics or just busying myself with my family.
